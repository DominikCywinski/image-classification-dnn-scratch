# Image Classification DNN from Scratch

This repository contains an implementation of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for classifying images as either "cat" or "non-cat". The project demonstrates how to build a neural network from scratch without relying on high-level libraries, focusing on the underlying principles of deep learning.

## Features

- Implemented a Deep Neural Network for binary classification
- Utilizes image data for training and evaluation
- Includes preprocessing steps for image data
- Simple and clear architecture

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12.3.
- NumPy.
- Matplotlib.

## Usage

1. Train model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
   
2. Place your .png in the ./predict_data directory (optional)

3. Make predictions:
  ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```
